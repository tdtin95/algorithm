The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

**Example 1:**

Input: m = 2, n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:

Right -> Right -> Down

Right -> Down -> Right

Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

Input: m = 5, n = 3

Output: 15
